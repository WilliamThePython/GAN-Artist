# GAN-Artist
A relatively simple Generator Adversarial Network algorithm which can take in photos and learn to replicate them.

This model uses a combination of photos which i didn't take myself, and some functions which i also didnt write myself.
I dont remember where I got either of them, unfortunetely. It's been a long time since I wrote this code.
Therefore, do whatever you want with this. I wont claim to be offended if you take this, distribute it, adapt it, do what you will.

The functions which I didnt write myself are in the file called GANFunctions.py

The photos which I didnt take, but used for training are located in the 'trainingphotos' directory.

Look in the main.py file for a simple run down on how to use this GAN model to generate images. 
I must admit, its not very good! But good enough to wow your friend(s)!
