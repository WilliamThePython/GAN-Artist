# GAN-Artist
A relatively simple Generator Adversarial Network algorithm which can take in photos and learn to replicate them.

1. In the main.py file, you will need to change the directories to point to the trainingphotos directory and the model directory respectively.
2. Then just run the main.py file. Do 10 epochs at first and then generate an image to make sure things are working.
3. Then do 100 epochs, and print another image, should look slightly more like a flower?
4. Try 1000, epochs, or let it run overnight!


This model uses a combination of photos which i didn't take myself, and some functions which i also didnt write myself.
I dont remember where I got either of them, unfortunetely. It's been a long time since I wrote this code.
Therefore, do whatever you want with this. I wont claim to be offended if you take this, distribute it, adapt it, do what you will.

The functions which I didnt write myself are in the file called GANFunctions.py

The photos which I didnt take, but used for training are located in the 'trainingphotos' directory.

Look in the main.py file for a simple run down on how to use this GAN model to generate images. 
I must admit, its not very good! But good enough to wow your friend(s)!

Also, I should add a warning for epileptics or visually sensitive people. 
This code tends to make gifs which are very, VERY, hard on the eyes sometimes due to flashing colours. Please be safe.
